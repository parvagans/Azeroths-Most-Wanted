A fully automated, high-performance static dashboard providing dynamic equipment, stats, and loot history for the World of Warcraft Classic guild **Azeroth's Most Wanted** (Thunderstrike). 

This project was built to demonstrate how to process thousands of API data points daily and render complex historical analytics **without a traditional backend or any recurring hosting fees.**

## ⚡ System Architecture: 100% Free & Serverless

Azeroth's Most Wanted Armory operates on a fully automated, zero-cost tech stack. By combining edge databases, static site generation, and GitHub Actions, the system achieves maximum uptime and zero database latency on the client side.

<div align="center">

### 1️⃣ EXTRACTION: Asynchronous Pull
<img src="asset/software_logo/python.png" height="50" alt="Python">

Python utilizes **AsyncIO** and **Aiohttp** to concurrently fetch live character profiles from the Blizzard REST API. A semaphore system acts as a bouncer to respect API rate limits while processing vast amounts of data in seconds.

⬇️

### 2️⃣ STORAGE: Edge Database
<img src="asset/software_logo/turso.png" height="50" alt="Turso"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="asset/software_logo/sqlite.png" height="50" alt="SQLite">

Processed data is pushed in chunked, bulk transactions to a **Turso** edge database (libSQL/SQLite) using direct REST API calls. This avoids driver bottlenecks and allows for infinite, free storage of historical guild trends and loot timelines.

⬇️

### 3️⃣ AUTOMATION: CI/CD Pipeline
<img src="asset/software_logo/github.png" height="50" alt="GitHub"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="asset/software_logo/cron.png" height="50" alt="Cron">

**GitHub Actions** acts as the server. A strict **Cron** schedule (or manual dispatch) triggers the workflow pipeline to authenticate, fetch API updates, push to the database, and rebuild the website without human intervention.

⬇️

### 4️⃣ COMPILATION: Static Generation
<img src="asset/software_logo/jinga.png" height="50" alt="Jinja2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="asset/software_logo/html5.png" height="50" alt="HTML5">

**Jinja2** templates ingest the latest database queries to dynamically generate raw HTML. The result is a lightning-fast, ultra-secure static frontend powered by HTML5 and modern CSS (bypassing the need for a Node.js framework).

⬇️

### 5️⃣ VISUALIZATION: Client-Side Rendering
<img src="asset/software_logo/json.png" height="50" alt="JSON">

Heavy payloads, like the thousands of lines of timeline activity, are pre-compiled into static **JSON** files (`timeline.json`, `roster.json`). The frontend consumes this data natively, using **Chart.js** to render heatmaps and analytics with zero database latency.

## Local validation before commit

One-command PowerShell validation:

```powershell
.\tools\validate-local.ps1
```

Local source preview:

```powershell
.\tools\preview-local.ps1
```

The preview server runs in the foreground so `Ctrl+C` stops it cleanly. If you only want to build the temp preview without serving it, use `.\tools\preview-local.ps1 -NoServe`.

If you have an older orphaned preview server from the previous background mode, you can clean it up with `.\tools\stop-local-preview.ps1`.

Manual fallback commands from `D:\projects\Azeroths-Most-Wanted` in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall -q main.py wow render tests
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover
git status --short --untracked-files=all
```

Required environment variables for the live pipeline:

- `BLIZZARD_CLIENT_ID`
- `BLIZZARD_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`
- `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`

`python main.py` is credentialed integration/pipeline execution, not the normal offline pre-commit test. It requires the Blizzard and Turso environment variables above, and it may write remote data and regenerate tracked output depending on the current code path. Passing offline validation does not prove live Blizzard/Turso integration is healthy.

GitHub Actions runs the same offline validation before the credentialed pipeline step.

Text files are LF-normalized in the repo to keep Windows and Unix diffs stable.

## GoatCounter custom domain

The analytics vanity domain is separate from the main GitHub Pages site.

- DNS record to create outside the repo: `stats CNAME nullbit5.goatcounter.com.`
- Custom domain to enter in GoatCounter: `stats.azeroths-most-wanted.eu.org`
- Do not switch the tracking code to the vanity domain until DNS and GoatCounter verification are complete.
- GoatCounter vanity domains are for display and do not bypass adblockers.
